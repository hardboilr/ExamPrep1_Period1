Refer to code in main.js for examples on each subject

##1. Explain the use of: "use strict"
Typically one would write "use strict"; at the top of the .js-file (global scope) or inside a function (local scope. 
Essentially it is used to defer the developer from writing dirty/lazy code. The compiler now returns an error when encountering "bad" syntax.

##2. Variable/function-Hoisting
At runtime the compiler will move variable declarations and functions up top  

##3.  this in JavaScript and how it differs from what we know from Java/.net

##4. Function Closures and the JavaScript Module Pattern 
Used to create reusable objects which can be used to create new instances of objects. 
Typically a module/reusable object contains some internal properties and some functions to manipulate these properties. 

##5. Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

(Also see example "Establishing private variables and accessors" from the wiki-page)

IFE's or Self Invoking Functions is a pattern to make a function invoke itself

##6. Prototyping and Objects

##7. The debugger

##8. User defined Callback Functions 

##9. Explain generally about node.js and NPM
Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. 

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. 

Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
