console.log("--- 3. this ---");

//Example 1: this in Global context (outside any function): refers to the document/window
this.a = 37;
console.log(document.a); // 37 <-- won't work in IDE though...

//Todo: why use var self = this;?
//more important, but boring stuff about this

// More examples at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this
// Sorry, but super boring subject, so can't be bothered with this right now... :-)
